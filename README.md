#CaravanPositioner

This is a little project made with the Stride game engine over the course of 2 days just so I could mess around with making a grid system, a procedural map generator, and a whole pathfinding system. This is meant to serve as my interpretation of how the caravan both positions itself and pathfinds itself to a colony in the game, RimWorld.

The code is split up into three main sections, the POCO class library which contains the vast majority of the functionality, the Tests for those POCOs, and then the actual Stride stuff, which there is not much of.

In order to start the project, all that you have to do is pull it, pull it up on Visual Studio, and run the default ConvoyPositioner.Windows.
